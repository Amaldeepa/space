<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:justify;">1.Mercury </h2>

<div style= "text-align:center;">

<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, boasts a myriad of intriguing features. With extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from scorching daytime highs of 430 degrees Celsius to frigid nighttime lows of -180 degrees Celsius, its lack of a substantial atmosphere contributes to this thermal extremity. Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury has a surprisingly slow rotation, taking 59 Earth days to complete one spin on its axis. Its eccentric orbit results in significant variations in distance from the Sun during its 88-day orbital journey. The planet's surface is a scarred landscape, adorned with craters, plains, and the expansive Caloris Basin. Named after the Roman god of commerce, Mercury harbors a large iron core, generating a magnetic field about 1.1% as strong as Earth's.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">2.venus </h2>

<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, stands out with a set of fascinating features. It rotates on its axis incredibly slowly, taking about 243 Earth days for a single rotation, yet its day, defined by one complete orbit around the Sun, lasts only about 225 Earth days. This results in a peculiar retrograde rotation, where the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Venus is enveloped in a thick atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun. The surface is marked by extensive volcanic plains, mountains, and a scattering of large impact craters.</p>


<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">3.Earth </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Earth, our remarkable home in the cosmos, teems with captivating features that set it apart. Nestled within the habitable zone, this dynamic planet boasts a diverse biosphere supporting an incredible array of life forms. Earth's rotation imparts a 24-hour day-night cycle, and its axial tilt gives rise to the seasons, providing a rich tapestry of climates and landscapes. With an abundance of liquid water covering about 71% of its surface, Earth stands as the only known celestial body to support life as we know it. The intricate interplay of atmospheric components, including oxygen, nitrogen, and other trace gases, sustains a delicate balance necessary for the existence of living organisms. </p>








<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">4.Mars </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," captivates the imagination with its unique characteristics. Boasting the tallest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system, Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively, Mars showcases a diverse and dramatic landscape. The planet's rusty hue comes from iron oxide, giving its surface a distinct color. Mars experiences wild temperature fluctuations, with daytime temperatures ranging from -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius) near the poles to a milder 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) at the equator. As the fourth planet from the Sun, Mars has a day length similar to Earth's, but its thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, contributes to a surface pressure only about 1% of Earth's. </p>


<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">5.Jupiter </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

<img src="planet7.jpeg">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, commands attention with its awe-inspiring features. Its colossal size, more than 11 times the diameter of Earth, makes it a giant gas giant. Jupiter's mesmerizing bands of clouds, including the iconic Great Red Spot—a massive storm that has been raging for centuries—create a dynamic and vibrant atmosphere. Despite its immense size, Jupiter's rapid rotation results in a day lasting just under 10 hours. This gas giant has a powerful magnetic field, over 14 times stronger than Earth's, generating intense radiation belts. Jupiter's extensive family of at least 79 known moons includes Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. </p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">6.Saturn </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

<img src="planet8.jpeg">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Saturn, the jewel of the solar system, enchants with its breathtaking rings, which are made up of icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to moonlets. These iconic rings extend thousands of kilometers from the planet's equator and are a spectacular sight through telescopes. Saturn's mesmerizing appearance is complemented by its radiant system of over 80 moons, with Titan standing out as the second-largest moon in the solar system and the only one with a thick atmosphere.<p/> 

<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">7.Uranus </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

<img src="planet14.jpeg">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, presents a host of intriguing characteristics. Most notably, it rotates on its side, making it the only planet in our solar system with a nearly horizontal axis of rotation. This unique tilt results in extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness during its 84-year orbit around the Sun. Uranus is often referred to as an "ice giant" due to its composition of icy materials, water, ammonia, and methane, which give it a distinctive blue-green hue. </p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">8.Neptune </h2>


<div style= "text-align:center;">

<img src="planet22.jpeg">

</div>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height: 35px;">Neptune, the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun, unveils a realm of captivating features. As the fourth-largest planet in our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant with a dynamic atmosphere dominated by vivid azure clouds and powerful storms. One such tempest is the Great Dark Spot, reminiscent of Jupiter's Great Red Spot but temporary and ever-changing. Neptune's winds are among the fastest in the solar system, reaching speeds of over 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kilometers per hour).</p>
